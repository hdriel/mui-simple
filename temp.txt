In the new version of npm (v7), by default, npm install will fail when it encounters conflicting peerDependencies.
It was not like that before.

--legacy-peer-deps
ignore all peerDependencies when installing,
in the style of npm version 4 through version 6.

--strict-peer-deps
fail and abort the install process for any conflicting peerDependencies when encountered.
By default, npm will only crash for peerDependencies conflicts caused by the direct dependencies of the root project.

--force
will force npm to fetch remote resources even if a local copy exists on disk.
